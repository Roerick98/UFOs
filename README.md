UFOs Sightings Page Constructed with JavaScript, Bootstrap
# Overview
For this project, we used JavaScript, HTML, and the CSS framework Bootstrap to construct a highly responsive UFO sightings website. Linking the necesssary javascript files with script tags within the HTML file, we were able to allow the website to respond to any of the five instances of search criteria and display the relevant information.

As you can see, the website contains a table filled with ufo sightings data and five filters to search for specific data. After entering specific search criteria, the table will update to display only matches for that specific search. For example, inputting the city el cajon returns the five instances of el cajon from the dataset. The user can use any amount of the filters to find more or less specific data.

# Summary
This website can be viewed on either a desktop, tablet, or mobile device and is formatted on a grid system using the css bootstrap framework. One drawback, however, is the fact that the user must input an exact string (that is found within the dataset) within one or more of the filters for the table to display the information.  This isn't too big of an issue in this case since the dataset isn't that large, however would certainly be problematic for another larger dataset. Future recommendations would be to add either an alert maessage that would display relevant matches for a portion of the input or an autofill feature within the filters themselves. This way the user would not have to know the exact information they are trying to look up from the dataset.
